Here they are.

I have written some poetry, theater scripts and art critique. I'm also working on a series of books, primarily focusing on military lives in a fantastical landscape, and the moral problems that go with their lives.
I also used to write blogs that focusing on philosophical issues in branches of Hinduism, which I stopped after the closure of the website.




As I am an amateur, I seek some guidance from you. Please read the few works that I have attached to this e-mail.
